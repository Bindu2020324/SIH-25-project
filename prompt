I want you to build a Panchakarma Management Software website using React for frontend, Supabase for backend/database, and integrate a chatbot for general queries. Please carefully include the following features:

üéØ Background & Goal

Panchakarma is gaining global recognition for detoxification, rejuvenation, and chronic disease management, but small and medium centers face issues like manual scheduling, inconsistent therapy quality, and poor digital patient management.

The goal is to build a software solution that combines traditional authenticity with modern digital efficiency.

üîë Core Features

Automated Therapy Scheduling

Patients can book, view, and modify their therapy sessions.

Staff/practitioners can manage all patient sessions in a calendar view.

Automated conflict handling (no double bookings).

Pre- and Post-Procedure Notifications

Send automated reminders/alerts about precautions patients must follow before and after therapy.

Support customizable channels ‚Üí in-app, email, SMS/WhatsApp (MSG91/FCM integration).

Patient Management

Secure registration/login (Supabase Auth).

Each patient can only see their own history, progress, and upcoming sessions.

Center staff can view/manage all patient details and session records.

Role-Based Dashboards

Patient Dashboard:

View upcoming & past therapies.

Progress tracking with graphs and milestones.

Submit feedback after sessions.

HIPAA-like workflows to ensure privacy.

Consent system for storing patient details.

Audit trails ‚Üí track who accessed/modified data.

üí¨ Chatbot

A chatbot should be integrated into the website.

It should answer general queries like:

What therapies are available?

Pre/post-procedure guidelines.

Contact/support information.

Use a simple FAQ-based bot OR connect to Dialogflow/OpenAI API.

üé® UI/UX

Mobile-friendly (important for rural/small centers).
